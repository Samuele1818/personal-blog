# Happiness

In shrill,brief and synoptic words,it is difficult not to portray happiness as one
distraction from concreteness.
A concreteness,a reality
that takes advantage of illusions and suffering to instigate the mind to flee.Feeling cannot but
not endure the difficulty of the vigilant life,and is urged
to escape through that which most fulfills it,fantasy.
To be shipwrecked in the delirium of unattainable desire,to be transported and transmuted into a world
anything but real,anything but authentic,composed only of dreams,is happiness.
Godspeed you Black emperor "lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven".
