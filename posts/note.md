# Note

Still don't explain why I have the need to be an evil and at the same time the solution of
self.In that sense I want to enjoy in the taste of her, who feels sinful and guilty - my greatest
hope.
An arrogant act of narcissism.
A sensual audacity in committing suicide at the hands of Cupidity.She is a murderer, however
received as a goal by those who are now dead or perhaps never born.
I was never born, I am only cloud of a macabre desire , nourished by the hope of having souls and
minds with a compass pointed at me.
I suffer from seeing the disturbing happiness of two actors, and therein lies my bloody and sadistic
pleasure in being the protagonist of the end of this play .
A forced and perpetual attempt to be a curator of a state of mind that I hope with all my heart
that I have created.
A beacon,a landmark for those who want to take refuge
without wondering if it was all a trap.
Without wondering who shook the waves.
Without wondering who it is that is hoping - and will forever relentlessly hope - to see you drown
to death, should you refuse the light of the lighthouse.
I don't know how to be anything else.
The pleasure of being a comforter. In dreams, I live in a long embrace with her, while listening to
the sound of a labored and discontinuous breathing of the weeping of a flower, splendid as
possible ,that was about to wither at my hands.
I want to feel that breath pulsing, a veil of warmth, on my chest or neck without feeling any pity, 
but only of complacency and satisfaction.
It is as if I am not worthy myself ,by my own hand, to be a happy victim of love.
I
That I try only to be evil and self-care , my greatest hope.
